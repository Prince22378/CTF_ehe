# CTF_Ethical Hacking Essentials

## Project Overview
* This repository contains the fina exercise solution for the Summer Ethical Hacking Essentials Online Course. The Project involves performing a series of penetration testing activities on a target virtua; machine, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and password cracking. The detailed steps and findings are documented in the attached report.

## Problem Statement
* The exercise required performing the following tasks:
  1. Reconnaissance and Enumeration:
     - use tools like `nmap` and `nikto` for network and web server scanning.
     - identify open ports, services and potential vulnerabilities.
  2. Exploitation
     - use discovered vulnerabilities to gain access to the target machine.
     - Employ tools ike Metasploit for exploiting services and applications.
  3. Password Cracking
     - Identify non-admin users and attempt to crack their passwords using brute force tools like Hydra.
     - Provice detailed steps, commands and outputs for each stage.

## Tools Used 
* Nmap: Network scanning and enumeration
* Nikto: Web server scanning
* Netdiscover: Network discovery tool
* Metasploit: Exploitation Framework
* Sqlmap: SQL Injection
* Hydra: Brute force password cracking tool

## Report Summary:
### Reconnaissance and Enumeration
     * Network Scanning:
         - Utilized `nmap` and `netdiscover` to identify the target VM and open ports.
         - Discovered services running on the target, including Apache HTTP server and FTP.
